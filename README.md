# solace-conflation-pub
A Solace Java application that will publish conflated blhablhalbhhab


Sometimes you don't always need to do conflation... sometimes you just want eliding, but
removing some of the requirements of certain topic levels.

For example: taxi/geo/xxx.xxxxx/yyy.yyyyy/route/num/status
      elide: taxi/geo/*/*/route/num/status
